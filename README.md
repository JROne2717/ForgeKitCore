Modular RPG framework for Godot 4.x. Free core data tools and editors. Advanced runtime systems available via Patreon.

ForgeKit Core

ForgeKit is a modular RPG framework for Godot 4.x.

It gives you structure, clean data tools, and a solid foundation so you can stop rebuilding the same systems every project.

The Core is free.
Advanced runtime systems are supported through Patreon.

Why ForgeKit Exists

If you’ve built more than one RPG in Godot, you already know the cycle.

You recreate stats.
You recreate items.
You recreate dialogue structures.
You wire it all up again.

ForgeKit exists to break that loop.

This is about building a foundation once and improving it over time, together.

What You Get in ForgeKit Core

Structured RPG data resources

Editor tooling to manage your data cleanly

Modular architecture designed to expand with your project

A foundation you can actually understand and modify

You are not locked into someone else’s vision of how your game should work.

ForgeKit gives you tools, not constraints.

What This Is Not

Not a finished RPG template

Not a no-code solution

Not an engine replacement

Not a black box system

You still build your game.
ForgeKit just removes the boring repetition.

Who This Is For

Indie developers building RPGs in Godot

Solo devs who want clean architecture

Small teams that value modular systems

Builders who like understanding their tools

If you care about structure and scalability, you will feel at home here.

Runtime Systems and Patreon

ForgeKit Core will always remain free.

Advanced runtime systems are developed separately and funded through Patreon support.

All paid tiers receive the full runtime layer.
Lower tiers receive updates at full release milestones.
Higher tiers receive access as systems are built.

The goal is simple:
Keep the foundation free. Fund the deeper systems sustainably.

Long Term Vision

ForgeKit starts with RPG systems.

The larger vision is a modular framework that can support multiple genres without becoming bloated or messy.

This will grow over time, in public.

ForgeKit is not just a plugin.
It’s a foundation we improve together.

ForgeKit started because rebuilding the same RPG systems every project stopped being exciting.

The goal is to build a clean, modular foundation once and improve it steadily instead of rewriting everything from scratch each time.

This is being developed openly and iterated on over time. It will evolve as it’s used in real projects.

If you’re here early, you’re helping shape what it becomes.

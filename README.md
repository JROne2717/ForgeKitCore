# ForgeKitCore
Modular RPG framework for Godot 4.x. Free core data tools and editors. Advanced runtime systems available via Patreon.

What Is ForgeKit?

ForgeKit is a structured framework for building RPG systems in Godot without starting from scratch.

It focuses on clean data architecture, editor tooling, and modular design so you can build faster without locking yourself into a rigid engine template.

ForgeKit Core includes the foundational tools. The runtime layer is available separately through Patreon.

What This Is Not

Not a drag-and-drop complete game

Not a visual scripting replacement

Not a restrictive “engine inside an engine”

Not a bloated all-in-one template

ForgeKit gives you structure, not constraints.

Who It’s For

Indie developers building RPGs in Godot

Devs who want strong data architecture

Teams that value modular systems

Solo devs tired of rebuilding the same RPG foundations

If you like clean systems and control over your project, this is for you.

What’s Included in ForgeKit Core

Core data resources
Editor tooling for managing RPG data
Structured architecture designed for expansion
Modular design so you can use only what you need

The Core is fully usable on its own.

Patreon Runtime Layer

Advanced runtime systems are developed separately and available to supporters.

This includes:

Combat runtime systems
Advanced progression systems
Extended gameplay frameworks
Ongoing feature updates

All paid tiers receive the full runtime.
Lower tiers receive updates at major release points.
Higher tiers receive early access during development.

The goal is sustainability without locking the foundation behind a paywall.

Design Philosophy

ForgeKit is built around three principles:

Modular by default

Expandable without refactoring

Clean data first, runtime second

You own your project. ForgeKit supports it.

Installation

Download or clone this repository

Place the addon folder inside your project’s res://addons/ directory

Enable ForgeKit in Project Settings under Plugins

Documentation will expand as features grow.

Roadmap Direction

RPG systems are the starting point.

Long term vision includes multi-genre support built on the same modular framework philosophy.
